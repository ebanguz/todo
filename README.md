## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Sass
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Vanilla JavaScript
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox) - PWA library

### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html

```

```scss

```

```js

```

### Continued development

The code has to be cleaner, the performance gotta be better, and a Bundler need to implement in this project.
